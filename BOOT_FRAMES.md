# SolaX Pocket WiFi — Boot Sequence Frames

This document describes the binary frames sent by the SolaX Pocket WiFi dongle
(ESP32-S2) during the inverter boot/start-up sequence.  These frames all arrive
on the `loc/tsp/<serial>` MQTT topic and share the same `$$` magic prefix, but
differ in length, function code, and content from the standard 107-byte real-time
data frame documented in the main source code.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer — speculative analysis**
>
> The frame layouts and field mappings described in this document are the result
> of two complementary but imperfect methods:
>
> 1. **Reverse engineering of a legacy SolaX WiFi dongle firmware** (an older
>    firmware version, *not* the firmware currently running on the inverter
>    described here).  That binary was statically analysed to identify the `$$`
>    frame format, field offsets, and the CRC algorithm.
>
> 2. **Cross-validation against real-world values**: the field positions inferred
>    from the legacy firmware were verified by comparing decoded values (voltages,
>    frequencies, energy counters, temperatures) against physically plausible
>    values observed on a live installation.
>
> Neither of these methods constitutes a definitive protocol specification.  In
> particular:
>
> - The boot-sequence frame types (79 B, 64 B, 46 B, 158 B) have **not** been
>   validated against the source code or current firmware of the dongle.
> - Field names, units, and interpretations are **best-effort guesses** and may
>   be incorrect.
> - **No accuracy is guaranteed** until a complete reverse-engineering of the
>   current dongle firmware has been performed.
>
> Contributions, corrections, and captures from other hardware revisions are
> very welcome.

All multi-byte integers in the SolaX `$$` protocol are **little-endian** unless
otherwise noted.  CRC values are **big-endian** and are computed with the
CRC-16/BUYPASS algorithm (also known as CRC-16/VERIFONE, poly `0x8005`, init
`0x0000`, no reflection).

## Common Frame Header (bytes `0x00`–`0x24`)

All observed `$$` frames share a 37-byte header with an identical layout:

| Byte(s) | Field | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `0x00–0x01` | Magic `$$` | Always `24 24` |
| `0x02–0x03` | Total frame length (LE u16) | Equals `len(frame)` |
| `0x04` | Message type | `0x08` = data upload |
| `0x05` | Protocol version | `0x01` in all observed frames |
| `0x06` | Sequence number | Usually `0x01`; `0x02` for the firmware-version frame |
| `0x07` | Function code | `0x1C` = real-time / config; `0x0E` = firmware version |
| `0x08–0x1C` | WiFi module serial number | 21 bytes, ASCII, NUL-padded |
| `0x1D` | Number of inverters | `0x01` |
| `0x1E` | DSP firmware version (raw) | Raw integer — see notes below |
| `0x1F` | ARM firmware version (raw) | Varies by boot stage — see notes below |
| `0x20` | Reserved | `0x00` |
| `0x21` | Hardware version | `0x01` or `0x02` |
| `0x22` | Firmware version major | e.g. `0x02` |
| `0x23` | Firmware version minor | e.g. `0x19` = 25 → "2.25", or `0x07` = 7 → "2.7" |
| `0x24` | Reserved | `0x00` |

> **Note on ARM firmware version (`0x1F`):** This field changes across boot
> frames from the same boot sequence, which suggests the dongle reports the
> partially-initialised firmware context at the time of each message rather than
> a fixed version string.  Example values observed in a single boot sequence:
> `0x2C` (44) in the 79-byte frame, `0x1D` (29) and `0x7B` (123) in the 64-byte
> and 158-byte frames respectively, `0x0B` (11) in the 46-byte frame, `0x48`
> (72) in the standard 107-byte frame.  The `0x1E`/`0x1F` combination is
> therefore unreliable during boot; only the 107-byte real-time frame carries
> stable firmware version information.

## Frame Type Summary

| Length | Hex | Function code | Contains | Stage |
|--------|-----|---------------|----------|-------|
| **79 B** | `0x4F` | `0x1C` | Partial real-time data (no inverter SN, no rated_power/run_mode) | Very early boot |
| **64 B** | `0x40` | `0x1C` | Inverter SN + rated_power only | Early boot (handshake) |
| **46 B** | `0x2E` | `0x0E` | WiFi firmware version string | Early boot |
| **158 B** | `0x9E` | `0x1C` | Inverter SN + config register address list | Mid-boot config dump |
| **107 B** | `0x6B` | `0x1C` | Full real-time data | Normal operation |

## Frame 1 — 79-byte Compact Real-Time Frame

### Description

Sent during the very first seconds of the boot sequence (observed at
`06:58:01` and `06:58:06` in the example log).  Two copies are emitted about
5 seconds apart.

It shares the function code `0x1C` with the standard 107-byte real-time frame
but is shorter because:

- The **inverter serial-number** section (21 bytes at `0x25–0x39`) is absent.
- The first 7 bytes of the standard data section (`rated_power`, `dsp_fw_version`,
  `run_mode`, `reserved`) are absent.

The remaining 40 bytes of data (starting at `0x25`) are in the same layout as
the standard real-time data section from offset `+0x07` onwards, i.e. starting
with `grid_voltage_V`.

At boot, AC power and PV currents are zero (inverter not yet injecting), PV
voltages show the open-circuit voltage of the panels, and `e_total` already
reflects the lifetime energy counter read from non-volatile memory.

## Frame 2 — 64-byte Minimal Handshake Frame

### Description

Sent during the early boot sequence (observed at `06:58:11`, ~5 s after the
compact frame).  Contains only the header, the full inverter serial number, and
the first two data words (`rated_power` and `dsp_fw_version`).  No real-time
sensor data is present.

This is likely the dongle announcing the connected inverter's identity and rated
power to the server before real-time data is available.

## Frame 3 — 46-byte Firmware-Version Response

### Description

Sent immediately after the minimal handshake (observed at `06:58:12`, sequence
number `0x02`).  Uses function code `0x0E` (firmware version query/response)
rather than `0x1C`.  The payload contains the WiFi module's firmware version
string in ASCII (`005.03`).

### Example frame

> sub-function echo (matching the function code), a length field, or a DSP
> firmware cross-reference (DSP FW = 14 = 0x0E); its precise role is unclear.

## Frame 4 — 158-byte Configuration Parameter Dump

### Description

Sent about 5–6 seconds after the firmware-version frame (observed at
`06:58:17`).  The frame header and inverter-SN section are identical to the
standard 107-byte frame, and the first four bytes of the data section
(`rated_power` and `dsp_fw_version`) are also correct.  However, from byte `+0x04`
onwards the data is **not real-time sensor values** — it is a configuration /
register-address dump.

If the standard 107-byte decoder is naïvely applied to this frame, the
`e_total` and `e_today` fields would read spurious values (e.g. 294.4 kWh and
345.6 kWh respectively), which are garbage produced by reinterpreting the config
bytes.

### Example frame

### Layout — config data section (bytes `0x3E`–`0x9B`)

From byte `0x3E` (data offset `+0x04`) onwards the bytes are configuration data
rather than real-time values.  The standard offsets for `run_mode`, `reserved`,
`grid_voltage`, etc. therefore contain garbage if decoded as real-time data.

The 94 config bytes are:

```
03 5B 00 20 00 80 01 80 02 80 03 80 04 80 05 80
06 80 07 80 08 80 09 80 0A 80 0B 80 0C 80 0D 80

## Frame 5 — 107-byte Standard Real-Time Frame (reference)

Included here for comparison.  This is the frame type decoded by the integration
in normal operation.  It appears after the boot sequence is complete (first seen
at `06:58:22` in the example log, ~30 s after boot started, and subsequently on
a regular ~5-minute interval during operation).

### Example frames

## Boot Sequence Timeline (example log)

```
06:58:01  79-byte compact frame  (CRC OK)  — grid live, panels at OCV, no output
06:58:06  79-byte compact frame  (CRC OK)  — same; slight panel voltage increase
06:58:11  64-byte minimal frame  (CRC OK)  — inverter SN + rated_power handshake
06:58:12  46-byte firmware frame (CRC OK)  — WiFi firmware = "005.03"
06:58:17 158-byte config frame   (CRC OK)  — register address list (0x8000–0x801F)
06:58:22 107-byte standard frame (CRC OK)  — first full real-time data frame
07:01:31 107-byte standard frame (CRC OK)  — subsequent normal update (~3 min later)
```

## CRC Reference

All frames use **CRC-16/BUYPASS** (poly `0x8005`, init `0x0000`, no input or
output reflection, no final XOR).  The CRC covers all bytes from the first `$`
to the last data byte, **excluding** the 2 CRC bytes themselves.  The CRC is
appended in **big-endian** order (high byte first).

Python reference implementation:

```python
def crc16_buypass(data: bytes) -> int:
    crc = 0x0000
    for byte in data:
        crc ^= byte << 8
        for _ in range(8):
            if crc & 0x8000:
                crc = ((crc << 1) ^ 0x8005) & 0xFFFF
            else:
                crc = (crc << 1) & 0xFFFF
    return crc
```

## Interactive Frame Decoder (Python helper script)

Copy the block below into a `.py` file (or run it directly with `python3`) to
decode frames interactively.  Paste the hex of any captured frame on one line
(spaces are ignored), press Enter, and the script prints the decoded fields.
Press **CTRL-C** to quit.

The script recognises all five frame types documented above, reports
**`wrong crc`** for a checksum mismatch, and **`frame unknown`** for any
length that is not in the table.

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** field interpretations are speculative — see the disclaimer
> at the top of this document.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
SolaX Pocket WiFi — interactive frame decoder.

Paste a hex frame on one line (spaces are ignored), press Enter.
Repeat for each subsequent frame.  Press CTRL-C to quit.

Recognised frame types
